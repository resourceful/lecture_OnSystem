{\bfseries Part 1: Instant OS Updates via Userspace Checkpoint-and-Restart }

\begin{questions}


\question What is the main idea for Instant OS updates in this paper?
\begin{solutionorlines}[2cm]
 a userspace checkpoint-and-restart mechanism
\end{solutionorlines}


\question What are the problems pointed out in this paper?
\begin{solutionorlines}[2cm]
 To complete  updates, users must reboot their systems, resulting in unavoidable downtime and further loss of the states of running applications. 
\end{solutionorlines}


\question What is the significance of this paper's solution?
\begin{solutionorlines}[2cm]
 instant kernel updates spanning across major kernel versions without any kernel modifications. 
\end{solutionorlines}



\question Why those OS update topic is important? 
\begin{solutionorlines}[2cm]
 OS have become complex and more prone to problem, OS update to solve these issues 
\end{solutionorlines}


\question What are the three components of an existing OS update?
\begin{solutionorlines}[2cm]
 Stop service, Soft reboot, Start service
\end{solutionorlines}


\question What are the KUP’s lifecycle?(3step)
\begin{solutionorlines}[2cm]
 checkpoint, In-kernel switch, Restart
\end{solutionorlines}


\question What kind of method they are used for reducing downtime?
\begin{solutionorlines}[2cm]
 incremental checkpoint and on-demand restore
\end{solutionorlines}



\question What is the properties on Incremental checkpoint?
\begin{solutionorlines}[2cm]
 Multiple snapshots
\end{solutionorlines}

\newpage
\question What kind of method they are used for inefficient C/R?
\begin{solutionorlines}[2cm]
 file offset-based address mapping (FOAM), and persistent physical pages (PPP)
\end{solutionorlines}


\question What kind of socket can be provided KUP?
\begin{solutionorlines}[2cm]
 TCP, UDP, netlink
\end{solutionorlines}


\question What is the factor to affect FOAM?
\begin{solutionorlines}[2cm]
 number of cache to-disk writes
\end{solutionorlines}



\question Why KUP has failure during restoration?
\begin{solutionorlines}[2cm]
 System call is removal or interface modification
\end{solutionorlines}


\question What kind of techniques are employed by KUP?
\begin{solutionorlines}[2cm]
Ⅰ. FOAM, New data abstraction for app C/R
	    Ⅱ. Fast in-kernel switching technique
          Ⅲ. PPP, reuse memory without an explicit dump,
\end{solutionorlines}


\question What is the meaning of this paper?
\begin{solutionorlines}[2cm]
 first work that realizes swift kernel updates without modifying any kernel source. 
\end{solutionorlines}


{\bfseries Part 2: Unsafe time handling in Smartphones }



\question What was the purpose of this paper?
\begin{solutionorlines}[2cm]
 First study of new class of software bugs on smartphones called sleep-included time bugs, and detect it
\end{solutionorlines}

\question What problems solved this paper?
\begin{solutionorlines}[2cm]
 Tool detects SITBs. It can help to Battery and Time Usage
\end{solutionorlines}
\newpage
\question What was the solution?
\begin{solutionorlines}[2cm]
 They created novel tool KLOCK
\end{solutionorlines}

\question What are current, main problems of smartphones?
\begin{solutionorlines}[2cm]
 Power requirement, Power supply, Battery life
\end{solutionorlines}

\question What is mean of CLOCK\_REALTIME function?
\begin{solutionorlines}[2cm]
 first read the real time clock during the kernel initialization phase and then later updated at every tick
\end{solutionorlines}


\question What is mean of CLOCK\_BOOTTIME function?
\begin{solutionorlines}[2cm]
 gives the time elapsed since the boot time
\end{solutionorlines}

\question What is SITB?
\begin{solutionorlines}[2cm]
 Sleep-included time bugs
\end{solutionorlines}

\question What are 4 categories of time usages in Android?
\begin{solutionorlines}[2cm]
 Timed callback, Time settings, Time Arithmetic, Logging
\end{solutionorlines}

\question What is usage pattern of Timed Callback?
\begin{solutionorlines}[2cm]
 code wishes to perform a certain task at future time. 
\end{solutionorlines}

\question What is usage pattern of Time Settings?
\begin{solutionorlines}[2cm]
 the subject code updates the current system time
\end{solutionorlines}
